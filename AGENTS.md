# Repository Rules & Guidelines

## 1. Changelog & History Maintenance
- **Automatic History Updates**: Whenever adding new features, fixing bugs, refactoring components, or altering UI/styles in this codebase:
  1. Document all changes in [`doc/history.md`](doc/history.md).
  2. Keep [`README.md`](README.md) and relevant documentation synchronized with feature and release states.
- **Date Format & Placement**:
  - In `doc/history.md`, group entries under the current date using the format `# DD.MM.YY` (e.g., `# 18.09.26`) placed chronologically at the top of the file directly beneath the frontmatter tags comment block.
  - Record detailed release notes and comprehensive per-change descriptions directly in `doc/history.md` and companion walkthrough files in `doc/prompts/`.
- **Entry Structure**:
  - Title the main change in bold with a clear feature/fix description.
  - Detail specific modifications with bullet points mentioning affected file paths, selectors/IDs, and technical/design decisions.
  - Preserve existing frontmatter tag comments at the top of the file.

## 2. Mandatory Prompt, Plan & Walkthrough Archiving
- **Automatic Per-Turn Full Conversation Updates**:
  - After **EVERY SINGLE** chat prompt-response cycle, you MUST update the session's comprehensive conversation archive (`doc/prompts/<Prefix>. <Session Title>.md`) by appending the new turn contents to it.
  - **DO NOT** create a new file for each individual prompt turn (avoid creating fragmented files like `<Prefix>.3`, `<Prefix>.4`, `<Prefix>.5`, etc.).
  - Append the current turn's verbatim user request, internal thinking (`### Thinking`), and final response (`### AI Response`) directly to the end of the session archive file, separated by horizontal rules (`---`).
- **Session Continuity & Updating Past Archives**:
  - Whenever an existing conversation or chat thread is continued, resumed, or revisited, you MUST locate and update the corresponding existing archive in `doc/prompts/<Prefix>. <Session Title>.md` by appending the new turns directly to it.
  - **DO NOT** create a new major sequence number or split an ongoing dialogue across multiple files when resuming or updating an existing chat.
  - If a past archive file was missed or is missing earlier turns from the current conversation, retroactively synchronize and append all missing turns so that the file contains the complete, uninterrupted history.
- **Fractional Suffixes Reserved for Plans & Walkthroughs Only**:
  - Minor/fractional prefixes (e.g., `<Prefix>.1`, `<Prefix>.2`, etc.) are reserved **exclusively** for companion implementation plans and walkthroughs:
    - Primary chat session: `doc/prompts/<Prefix>. <Session Title>.md` (contains all turns sequentially)
    - Implementation plan: `doc/prompts/<Prefix>.1 Implementation Plan - <Plan Title>.md`
    - Walkthrough document: `doc/prompts/<Prefix>.2 Walkthrough - <Title>.md`
    - Subsequent plans/walkthroughs within the same session: `<Prefix>.3 Implementation Plan - ...`, `<Prefix>.4 Walkthrough - ...`, etc.
- **Mandatory Dual-Write on Every Turn**:
  - **Implementation Plans**: Whenever creating or updating an implementation plan artifact (`implementation_plan.md`), you MUST simultaneously write a copy to `doc/prompts/<Prefix>.<N> Implementation Plan - <Plan Title>.md` before pausing for user review.
  - **Walkthroughs**: Whenever creating or updating a walkthrough artifact (`walkthrough.md`), you MUST simultaneously write a copy to `doc/prompts/<Prefix>.<N> Walkthrough - <Title>.md` upon completing execution.
  - **Full Conversation Archive**: Update and append the active turn to `doc/prompts/<Prefix>. <Session Title>.md` immediately upon generating the response on every turn.
- **Target Location**: All prompt, plan, and walkthrough records reside in the [`doc/prompts`](doc/prompts) directory.
- **Prefix Sequencing Strategy**:
  - Inspect existing files in `doc/prompts/` to identify the current major sequence integer (e.g. `1.`, `2.`, `3.`, `4.`, `5.`, etc.).
  - Increment the sequence integer ONLY when starting an entirely distinct, new conversation session that does not belong to a pre-existing thread.
  - Keep all conversation turns for that session inside the main file `doc/prompts/<Prefix>. <Session Title>.md`.
- **Chat Archive Fidelity**:
  - Reproduce the conversation exactly as the source (user request blocks verbatim).
  - Include the model's internal thinking/reasoning parts (`### Thinking`) alongside the final response (`### AI Response`).
  - Preserve the frontmatter tags comment block at the top of the archive file.

## 3. Code Quality & Styling Standards
- Follow the established vanilla JavaScript and CSS conventions across the repository (`index.html`, `index.css`, `index.js`).
- Avoid introducing unnecessary third-party runtime frameworks or heavy libraries unless explicitly requested.
- Maintain responsive design, glassmorphism, smooth animations, and dark theme consistency across all interactive modules, cards, and modal components.

## 4. Commit Message & Chat Summary Generation
- **Commit Message & Description Suggestion**:
  - At the end of every response, summarize the work completed across the chat session (referencing the active prompt archive in `doc/prompts/<Prefix>. <Session Title>.md`).
  - Suggest a ready-to-use Git commit message with a structured commit description at the very end of the response.
